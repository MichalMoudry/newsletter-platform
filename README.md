[![Build and test project](https://github.com/MichalMoudry/newsletter-platform/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MichalMoudry/newsletter-platform/actions/workflows/go.yml)

# Application description
The newsletter app enables newsletter editors to register and manage their own newsletter that consumers can subscribe to. Editors can then publish news in the newsletter and send them to all subscribers.

API should be able to serve both mobile apps and websites using REST API. The API backend should use two different storage services to maintain the data. User accounts are stored in the Postgre SQL database, whereas subscribers are stored in Firebase.
